Items
=====

Item's are obtained automatically during your levelling up. There are currently 3 slots a player can have an item it:

* Helm
* Armor
* Weapon

On level up, an item will be randomly generated, and slotted on the levelling up player. If the player has a current item in that slot, it will be removed, and replaced by the new item.
