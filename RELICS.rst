Relics
======

Relics are game wide artifacts that get contributed to by pooling together players gold. Once the purchase amount has been crossed, the relic will be "purchased" and a new relic will be randomly generated and the server will then have to work towards that.

Note: As of right now, Relics serve no purpose other than a game wide goal to work towards.
