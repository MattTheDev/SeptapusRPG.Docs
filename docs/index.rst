# What is this?
Septapus RPG is a game you play in chat that rewards active conversations. Form a party and battle a never ending horde of monsters, gain experience, level up find items and have fun with your friends!

# What are the rules?
* Whenever you type a message you will join the current party, the party will then do damage to the monster equal to the size of the party.
* When a monster is defeated the party will gain experience equal to the size of the party, and a random person in the party will gain credit for slaying the monster.
* Whenever you level up, you will gain an item of ever increasing power and strength, but your items are just for show! They don't do anything interesting (yet!).
* While you are chatting you gain gold each minute. The longer you stay around the more gold you get each minute. Everyones gold is used to buy relics for the channel, the relics don't do anything except show how cool the channel is.
* Sometimes a Dragon will appear, slaying Dragons is important and will grant you a title if you are the lucky one who lands the killing blow.

# But can't I just cheat by flooding the channel?
No! Not only are the rules made to reward larger parties, but multiple messages by the same person are ignored and you can only fight once every minute.
